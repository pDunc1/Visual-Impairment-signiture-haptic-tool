# Haply-Haptic-Project
Using position control, bezier functions and other exploration types to aid in visual representation for the people with vision impairments with the Haply Haptic Device

10th Order Matlab is code used to upload a trace as a JPEG file to ascertain bezier coordinate computaionally in MATLAB. This saves the Bezier coordiantes directly into a csv file to be accessed by the Guided Exploration 10th order folder for Processing. Here the Bezier coordinates are converted back to form the trace for the Haply end effector tool to follow and guide a user around.

The Signiture_pde is a processing sketch that involves unguided and collaborative exploration. A facilitator can link with the avatar to guide the user around a path or the user can explore shapes and characters created in the Fisica Sketch by the feeling of friction.
